# Quick start

Set up `bundle` so that it does not mess up with system packages:

    export GEM_HOME=$HOME/.gem

Now install the dependencies:

    bundle install

To run a local copy of the site:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload


# How to create new posts

Simply create a new text file with the extension `.markdown` in the `_posts` directory.

Be sure to keep one sentence per line.

    ```c++
    int main() {}
    ```

    Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

    ```ruby
    def print_hi(name)
      puts "Hi, #{name}"
    end
    print_hi('Tom')
    #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
    ```

    $$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$
