    <p>A few days ago I recalled an old article I read many years ago about “Morley’s triangles”. It is a geometrical property of triangles found by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Morley">Frank Morley</a> (1860–1937): if you trisect each of the three inner angles and intersect the lines, you will get an inner triangle that is <em>always equilateral</em>. You can find more information and proofs in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morley's_trisector_theorem">Wikipedia page</a> and on <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MorleysTheorem.html">MathWorld</a>. I remember that the article I read many years ago tried to explain why such a simple result was not discovered by Greek mathematicians, since a large part of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> covers their properties. The most likely reason is that ancient Greeks didn’t like the idea of “trisecting” an angle, as it cannot be done with a ruler and a compass.</p>

<p>I would have loved to explain them to my children (the youngest has started studying Euclidean geometry in this school year!), but I looked for an interactive way to visualize them and found nothing close to what I wanted. I wanted just to show the <em>first</em> triangle (there are 18 of them!), and I wanted that the user could drag the vertexes of the triangle to explore how the inner triangle stays equilateral despite the deformations of the outer triangle.</p>

<p>I decided it would have been fun to implement this program in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>: it’s been years I’m wanting to study it but have never found the occasion… before today. I bought the book “Mastering TypeScript” by Nathan Rozentals (<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-typescript/9781800564732">Packt publishing</a>): in these days, it’s just $10 instead of $32.99. I picked this book because of the very good reviews on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-TypeScript-enterprise-ready-applications-frameworks/dp/1800564732">Amazon</a>, and I can tell you that they are well deserved. The book is wonderful: clear explanations, good examples, full of practical tips about the best workflow to write, run, and test your programs. I found it so clear that I was able to quickly implement a widget to interactively explore Morley’s theorem.</p>

<p>Here is the result, you can drag any of the vertexes of the outer triangle and see how the inner triangle keeps being equilateral:</p>
