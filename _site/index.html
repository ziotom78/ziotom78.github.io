By “low quality”, I do not mean that they were not fit for the job.
Rather, the applicant seriously underestimated their actual achievements; they even <em>forgot</em> to put something totally relevant for the job!</p>

        </h3><p>Since a few years I am a teacher assistant in a C++ class for second-year students at the department of physics of the Università degli Studi di Milano.
It is a mandatory class where students learn how to use C++ and Object-Oriented Programming to solve numerical problems like root finding, integration, and differential equation solving.
The teacher does not force people to use specific tools, but most of the students rely on G++ and Visual Studio Code to write their code. (It is mandatory that students use GNU Make to write their code, as the teacher believes that this is more instructive than learning higher-level tools like CMake.)
The usage of Visual Studio Code is a big step forward, as in the pre-COVID era they all used Gedit, as VSCode was not available in the computers in the lab!</p>

            Morley&#39;s triangles
          </a>
        </h3><p>A few days ago I recalled an old article I read many years ago about “Morley’s triangles”. It is a geometrical property of triangles found by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Morley">Frank Morley</a> (1860–1937): if you trisect each of the three inner angles and intersect the lines, you will get an inner triangle that is <em>always equilateral</em>. You can find more information and proofs in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morley's_trisector_theorem">Wikipedia page</a> and on <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MorleysTheorem.html">MathWorld</a>. I remember that the article I read many years ago tried to explain why such a simple result was not discovered by Greek mathematicians, since a large part of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> covers their properties. The most likely reason is that ancient Greeks didn’t like the idea of “trisecting” an angle, as it cannot be done with a ruler and a compass.</p>
